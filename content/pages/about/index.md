Hello. I'm Ernesto, I sincerely prefer to be called Neto. I'm a multidisciplinary person. Most of my time is spent managing teams, interacting with clients, managing projects, developing, and enjoying my family.

I don't like to define myself by the work I have done. I define myself
by the goals I want to achieve. Skills can be learned at any time, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, keep challenging myself and do interesting things that matter that really add value to society and my family.

With a high energy level and boundless enthusiasm, I am very inspired and more than willing to follow my goals wherever they take me. I am a passionate, expressive and multi-faceted spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire.

I am never content to just come up with ideas. Instead, I have an almost impulsive need to put them into practice. My abundant energy drives me to pursue many interests, hobbies, areas of study and technological endeavors. I am a quick learner, able to acquire new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease. I enjoy gaining experience in various areas throughout my life and career.

I am a person with deep emotions and empathy, I love to inspire and be inspired by others to continue to grow primarily on a personal level. I am able to inspire and am at my best when I share my creative expressions with others.
