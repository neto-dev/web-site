# Let's make something great!

I'm seeking out opportunities to collaborate with companies / agencies / individuals, not just work for them. I want to bring my collective software development experience to the table where we can work together to solve real business-problems in a way that optimizes all of our respective experience and knowledge.

I want to avoid subjective pissing-matches, and favor open-minded collaborators where egos are out of the equation.
If that all sounds about right, feel free to reach out through any platforms bellow:
